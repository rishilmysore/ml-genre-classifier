# Genre Classifier
## Trained from the GTZAN dataset

This machine learning project developed by 2 undergraduate Virginia Tech students allows the user to classify an audio sample into a genre. One model is a convoluted neural network which was trained from images developed from the GTZAN dataset audio files. The second is a k-nearest neighbor model which was trained from a CSV file containing 60 features. These models can be used towards building a music recommendation system.

The dataset can be found from this kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification.
